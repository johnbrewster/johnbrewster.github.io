I have over 30 years’ experience in running a practice that produces successful projects for clients throughout Scotland. From small domestic works, to larger new build houses and residential schemes, as well as a wide range of commercial projects, I am experienced in a range of building solutions, including traditional home construction as well as timber framed and SIPs methods. I have a proven record of successful negotiations, dealing with difficult planning matters.

I enjoy working with clients to establish an initial brief that ensures that they can achieve exactly what they require. This would be a building that utilises space and materials in imaginative and resourceful ways, providing a budget conscious and energy efficient solution that satisfies the client’s established needs. It can also, where required, provide the flexibility to deliver adaptable or extendable solutions for future requirements.

The intention is always to create satisfied clients by providing them with realistic, sensible solutions for all projects, large or small.

Professional planning, management and support for all the phases of your building project.
