I have over 30 years’ experience in providing successful projects for clients throughout Scotland. From small domestic works, to larger new build houses and residential schemes, as well as a wide range of commercial projects, I am experienced in a range of building solutions, including traditional home construction as well as timber framed and SIPs methods. I also have a proven record of successful negotiations, dealing with difficult or complex planning matters.

I enjoy working with clients to establish an initial brief that ensures that they can achieve exactly what they require. This would be a building that utilises space and materials in imaginative and resourceful ways, providing a budget conscious and energy efficient solution that satisfies the client’s established needs. It can also, where required, provide the flexibility to deliver adaptable or extendable solutions for future requirements.

The intention is always to create satisfied clients by providing them with realistic, sensible solutions for all projects, large or small.


I provide a wide range of services, from informal initial discussions and recommendations right through to completed developments. I can supply professional planning, management and support for all the phases of your building project.

These are some of the services I can provide:

* feasibility studies
* customised design planning
* local authority negotiations
*	outline and detailed planning applications
*	building warrant applications
*	project development and coordination
*	new build homes
*	house extensions and alterations
*	residential and steading developments
*	construction of flats and houses
*	retail, commercial and industrial buildings
*	agricultural buildings
*	leisure industry projects
*	redevelopment and change of use planning
*	maintenance and preservation of listed buildings
*	church surveys and reports
*	measured surveys and deed plans
*	graphic design and artwork


The office is normally open weekdays between 9:00am and 5:00pm, but I am usually available outwith these times and at weekends to meet with clients and discuss projects, whenever it suits, in my office or at their home or place of work.

If you would like to discuss your particular project, please call or send an e-mail. I look forward to working with you to realise your projects.
